## Note

This is pre-pre-alpha.  
As in: I wrote it, looked at the page, seemed to be working, shoved it on GitHub.  
My SN instance is pretty small (single-user, not many notices); I don't know how well it behaves on larger instances.

## Instructions

Drop the files in your `/plugins/` folder  
Tell `/config.php` to use it with: `addPlugin('SocialAnalytics');  
You should now have a 'Social Analytics' item in your SN left navigation.
